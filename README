Welcome to the Urban Airship client library for Android.

Add the library to your project using Android Studio
----------------------------------------------------
Include the urbanairship-lib-x.x.x.aar file as a dependency in the project.

1. Open your project in Android Studio
2. Go to File -> New Module -> Import from .JAR or .AAR Package
3. Select the downloaded urbanairship-lib-x.x.x.aar file
4. Add the Urban Airship library, Android Support v4 library (revision 21 or newer),
   Android Support v7 CardView library (revision 21 or newer, required for in-app
   messaging) and Google Play Service GCM and Location (version 7.0 or newer) as
   dependencies in the build.gradle file:

        dependencies {
            compile project (':urbanairship-lib-x.x.x')
            compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:22.0.0'

            // Required for Android push notifications
            compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:7.0.0'

            // Recommended for in-app messaging
            compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:22.0.0'

            // Recommended if using location services
            compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:7.0.0'
        }


5. Sync the project with the gradle file

Add the library to your project using Eclipse
---------------------------------------------
The Urban Airship library needs to be added as a project with resources. Import
the "urbanairship-lib" project from the zip. Then include the project and the
v4 support library as a library dependency. More detailed steps for including
library projects with resources can are available in the Android Developer docs
http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject
